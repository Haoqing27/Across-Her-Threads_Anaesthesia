💻 Across Her Threads
Fashion is political. Know your worth.

📝 Description
Across Her Threads is an interactive website project that challenges the way society defines femininity, using fashion as a bold, political tool. Through a mix of satire, storytelling, and design, the site explores how women throughout history have broken stereotypes and embraced their power.

🎯 Purpose
To empower young women to rethink societal expectations, reclaim their self-worth, and understand that fashion is more than appearance—it's identity, resistance, and voice.

🎯 Target Audience
Teenage girls, young women, and anyone who has felt trapped by gender roles, beauty standards, or the need to be “chosen.”

🧠 Concept
This project critiques harmful beauty narratives through an unusual shopping experience and celebrates powerful women in history who used fashion as part of their resistance. It encourages users to discover confidence from within, not through external validation.
